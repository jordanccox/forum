# Simple Forum

This is a simple forum I built as a part of [Parsity's](https://parsity.io/) curriculum to practice DOM (Document Object Model) manipulations.

## Features:

- Add a new post
- Like or dislike a post
- Posts are sorted based on number of likes (most liked post appears at the top of the forum, least liked at the bottom)
